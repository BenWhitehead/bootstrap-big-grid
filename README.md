Documentation and Tests
=======================
http://benwhitehead.github.io/bootstrap-big-grid/

Motivation
==========
Bootstraps Grid only provides a grid up to 1200px wide, this project provides more grids for common higher resolutions all the way up to 8K.

Changelog
=========
09/10/2017 Updated grid class names and sizes for a more even spread of breakpoints at higher resolutions and to ensure future class compatibility with Bootstrap 4.
- ```col-xlg-*``` => ```col-hd-*```
- ```col-uhd-*``` => ```col-4k-*```, breakpoint at 3840px
- ```col-4k-*``` => ```col-5k-*```, changed breakpoint from 4096px to 5120px
- ```col-8k-*``` changed from 8192px to 7680px

28/07/2017 Updated for Bootstrap 3.3.7

Usage
=====
The easiest way to use Bootstrap Big Grid is with Bower
```bash
bower install --save bootstrap-big-grid
```

Alternatively download a [release](https://github.com/BenWhitehead/bootstrap-big-grid/releases) and use the css files in the dist directory.

Then link it into your page after the main bootstrap css

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/bootstrap-big-grid/dist/css/bootstrap-big-grid.min.css"/>
```

Project Status
==============

Unfortunately I no longer work on UI projects and as such I don't have the time required to keep this project always up to date with the latest version of bootstrap.  If you would like to submit a PR i'd be happy to merge it as long as it doesn't break existing functionality. Or, if you'd like feel free to fork the repo and start making improvments.

Thanks for your understanding.
